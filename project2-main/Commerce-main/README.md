# Commerce
Design an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.”

## Overview
Commerce is the second project for Harvard CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course.
The project specifications are listed [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/).


## Project Demos
A [full demo of my project](https://youtu.be/zAKewnSbRw8) can be viewed on YouTube along with all [other CS50 Web Projects](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6kIwIV_2O_gfcx46gplsaybo8c9vTb3d).
